Contributing to coderacer-samples
=================================

We appreciate any contributions to our repo of code samples.  Listed below are a few rules to follow before submitting a pull request.

#### 1. Ensure the code isn't already in the repo.

[DRY](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself).

#### 2. Ensure the code has an open-source license or is your own.

We aren't looking to get sued here.

#### 3. As a general rule, code samples should be less than 30 lines.

We want [coderacer](http://coderacer.com) to be fun and challenging, but not overbearingly difficult.  Players only have five minutes to complete the race, and it should almost never take that long.  (Most people don't have that long of an attention span.)  With that in mind, use your own judgement of length/difficulty, but we will reject any samples that are absurdly hard.

#### 4. As a general rule, code samples should be longer than 15 lines.

The reverse of above also applies.

#### 5. The code should be properly formatted.

We follow [Google's Style Guide](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/), so please ensure the code you are submitting conforms before making a pull request.

#### 6. Place the code in the correct folder.

This one should be obvious.  If there's no folder, create one.

#### 7. Name the code sample appropriately.

If you're adding multiple samples from the same file (which is totally fine!), please append `_i` to later samples.  For example `action_view.rb` and `action_view_1.rb` are both samples that have already been added.

#### 8. Submit a pull request!

After you've added some samples, just submit a new pull request and the code you've added will be live right after we accept!
